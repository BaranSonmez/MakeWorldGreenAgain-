# MakeWorldGreenAgain-

In this project, we aim to make a research about predicting air pollution level by taking advantage of machine learning algorithms and other works made before.  Our dataset consists of hourly meteorological parameters and concentrations of molecular level air pollutants in a certain city. We would like to predict the peak value of the pollutants for the rest of the day by benefitting this dataset. We considered the problem from two different ways. At first, we considered it as a classification problem so we chose using neural network and decision tree to estimate the density level of the pollutants. As the second way, we tried to estimate the peak value so we have picked regression. This was necessary to foresee the AQI (Air Quality Index) of the day because this estimation requires numerical values. For AQI estimation we also tried polynomial regression and classification. For classification we have used support vector machine algorithm. Estimating peak value gave us the chance to estimate the AQI of the day. That is why we consider this approach more important.
